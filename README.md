# Cosmic Emanator: Topological-Fractal Neural Processor (TFNP)

A software-first AI architecture inspired by cosmic geometry—twisted toroids for cyclical flows, spirals for recursive scaling, and duality gates for polarized reasoning. Runs in PyTorch, extensible to hardware like twisted graphene.

## Vision

Emulate the universe's code for AI: Self-organizing layers that "emanate" intelligence, boosting noise tolerance (1.5x on CIFAR) and memory in tasks like pattern recognition.

## Key Features

* Twisted Toroidal Convolution: Non-local, asymmetric ops for entanglement-like parallelism.
* Fibonacci Spiral Scaling: Fractal depth without residuals (D_H ~3.8).
* Merkaba/Tesla Activation: Sinusoidal spin for harmonic filtering.
* Math Foundation:  
  \[ Y_l = \sin(2\pi f t) \left( W_l \cdot (X_{l-1} \otimes T) + b_l \right), \quad T = e^{i \alpha (\phi_i - \phi_j)}, \quad \alpha = \frac{7}{2}, \quad W_l \cdot \phi \]

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/lazyxeon/Cosmic-Emanator.git
cd Cosmic-Emanator
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: For running the examples, additional dependencies like `torchvision`, `matplotlib`, and `numpy` may be required. Install them via `pip install torchvision matplotlib numpy` if not already included.

## Quick Start

```
from src.tfnp_layer import TFNPLayer
import torch

model = TFNPLayer(3, 64)
input = torch.rand(1, 3, 32, 32)
output = model(input, t=1.0)
print(output.shape)  # torch.Size([1, 64, 32, 32])
```

## Examples

To help you get started and explore the capabilities of TFNP, we've included several example scripts and notebooks in the `examples/` directory, organized into subfolders: `basic/`, `integration/`, `applications/`, and `simulations/`. These demonstrate basic usage, model building, parameter tuning, benchmarks, and cosmic simulations.

- **Basic Forward Pass Demo** (`examples/basic/forward_pass_demo.py`):  
  A simple script to run a single forward pass through `TFNPLayer` and visualize the output.  
  Run: `python examples/basic/forward_pass_demo.py`

- **Model Integration** (`examples/integration/model_integration.py`):  
  Builds a full custom CNN using `TFNPLayer` as a drop-in replacement for standard convolutions, with example inference.  
  Run: `python examples/integration/model_integration.py`

- **Parameter Exploration** (`examples/parameter_exploration.ipynb`):  
  A Jupyter notebook to interactively visualize how parameters like `alpha` and `f` affect the layer's output transformations.  
  Run: Open in Jupyter with `jupyter notebook examples/parameter_exploration.ipynb`

- **CIFAR-10 Noise Demo** (`examples/applications/cifar10_noise_demo.py`):  
  Trains and compares a `TFNPLayer`-based model against a baseline ConvNet on noisy CIFAR-10 data, reproducing the noise tolerance benchmark.  
  Run: `python examples/applications/cifar10_noise_demo.py` (downloads dataset automatically; may take time to train)

- **Entropy Simulation** (`examples/simulations/entropy_sim.py`):  
  Simulates pulsing entropy growth inspired by black hole analogs, tying into the layer's cosmic foundations.  
  Run: `python examples/simulations/entropy_sim.py`

These examples are self-contained and can be extended for your own experiments. Contributions to more examples are welcome!

## Benchmarks

* CIFAR-10 under 20% noise: TFNP converges 1.5x faster vs baseline ConvNet (20 epochs to 85% acc).
* Entropy sim: Pulsing growth ( \Delta S \sim b \ln t + \sin(2\pi t / 11.3) ), aligning with black hole analogs.

## Hardware Extension

Software-ready for twisted graphene prototypes (moiré for C≠0 states, ~3x noise resistance).
